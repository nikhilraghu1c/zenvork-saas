# Frontend architecture

The Angular application is located in `UI/zenvork-ui` and uses Angular 21 standalone components.

## Structure

```text
src/app/
├── core/        # Cross-cutting guards and services
├── layouts/     # Route-level public and authenticated shells
├── modules/     # Lazy-loaded page modules
└── shared/      # Reusable navigation and UI wrapper components
```

## Routing

Public and authenticated experiences use separate route-level layouts. `PublicLayoutComponent` owns
public navigation and public routes; `AppLayoutComponent` will own authenticated navigation and
guarded `/app` routes. Feature pages are lazy-loaded. The current public routes are `/` and
`/register` and `/login`.

## Component conventions

- Components are standalone.
- Every component has `.ts`, `.html`, `.scss`, and `.spec.ts` files.
- Component SCSS is parent-scoped and responsive.
- Pages compose shared Zenvork UI wrappers instead of directly depending on Angular Material when a wrapper exists.

## API services

`core/services/api.service.ts` owns the default API domain and generic `get`, `query`, `post`,
`put`, and `delete` methods. Its requests include credentials so the browser can use Zenvork's
HttpOnly authentication cookie. The local backend domain is `http://localhost:4001`; its CORS
configuration allows the Angular development origin at `http://localhost:4200`. Module-owned
services define feature endpoints and request/response types by composing that client; for example,
business registration belongs to `modules/register`. The registration module fetches active business
types from `GET /api/business-types` and submits the selected `businessTypeId`; it does not hardcode
the selectable platform types.
